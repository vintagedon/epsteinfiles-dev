# Work Logs

Phase worklogs documenting project development history. Each milestone gets a subfolder with a README synthesizing decisions, outcomes, and artifacts.

---

## Procedure

See [milestones-one-and-two-procedures.md](milestones-one-and-two-procedures.md) for M01/M02 execution.

Use `docs/documentation-standards/worklog-readme-template.md` for phase READMEs.

## Structure

```
work-logs/
├── 01-ideation-and-setup/      # M01: Repo scaffolding, docs, initial commit
├── 02-github-project-frameout/ # M02: Labels, milestones, tasks, sub-tasks
├── [03-domain-specific]/       # Project-specific milestones
├── milestones-one-and-two-procedures.md
└── README.md                   # This file
```

## Conventions

- Folder naming: `NN-phase-name` (zero-padded, hyphenated)
- Each folder contains a `README.md` documenting that phase
- Scripts, configs, and artifacts live alongside the README
- Worklogs are synthesis documents (outcomes, not session transcripts)
