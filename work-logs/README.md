# Work Logs

Phase worklogs documenting project development history. Each milestone gets a subfolder with a README synthesizing decisions, outcomes, and artifacts.

---

## Procedure

See [milestones-one-and-two-procedures.md](milestones-one-and-two-procedures.md) for M01/M02 execution.

Use `docs/documentation-standards/worklog-readme-template.md` for phase READMEs.

## Conventions

- Folder naming: `NN-phase-name` (zero-padded, hyphenated)
- Each folder contains a `README.md` documenting that phase
- Scripts, configs, and artifacts live alongside the README
- Worklogs are synthesis documents (outcomes, not session transcripts)
