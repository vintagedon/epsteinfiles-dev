## 🏗️ Architecture

[Brief explanation of how the project is organized and why]

### [Architecture Diagram]

<!-- 
Use Mermaid for editable diagrams, or static images for complex visualizations.
Place primary architecture visual here.
-->

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Layer 1"
        A[Component A]
        B[Component B]
    end
    
    subgraph "Layer 2"

        D[Component D]
    end
    
    A --> C
    B --> D
```

### [Key Architecture Table]

<!-- Use tables for structured technical information -->

| Component | Implementation | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| [Component] | [Technology] | [What it does] |
| [Component] | [Technology] | [What it does] |

<!-- Optional: Include hardware/infrastructure image if relevant -->

## 🌟 Open Science Philosophy

We practice open science and open methodology — our version of "showing your work":

- Research methodologies are fully documented and repeatable
- Infrastructure configurations are version-controlled and automated
- Scripts and pipelines are published so others can learn, adapt, or improve them
- Learning processes are captured and shared for community benefit

All projects operate under open source licenses (primarily MIT) to ensure maximum reproducibility.
