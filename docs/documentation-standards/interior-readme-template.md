TEMPLATE USAGE NOTES (remove when using):

1. FRONTMATTER: Always include. Tags enable RAG retrieval.

2. SEMANTIC NUMBERING: If you omit a section, preserve the gap.
   - Correct: 1, 2, 4 (section 3 omitted)
   - Wrong: 1, 2, 3 (renumbered)

3. SECTIONS:
   - §1 Contents: Always include (tree view)
   - §2 Recipes: Include if directory contains recipes
   - §3 Subdirectories: Include if subdirectories exist
   - §4 Related: Include if meaningful relationships exist

4. EXPANSION: Add sections as needed (5, 6, ...) for:
   - Usage notes
   - Security considerations
   - Common patterns
   - Whatever the directory needs

5. KEEP IT LEAN: This template is intentionally minimal.
   Add what's needed, don't fill sections for completeness.
