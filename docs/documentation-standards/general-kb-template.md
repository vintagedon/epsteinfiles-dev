TEMPLATE USAGE NOTES (remove when using):

1. FRONTMATTER: Always include. Tags enable RAG retrieval.

2. SEMANTIC NUMBERING: 
   - Sections 1-3 (Purpose/Scope/Audience) are the wrapper
   - Section 4+ is your content
   - If you omit wrapper sections, preserve numbering gaps
   - References and Doc Info are always last (use N, N+1)

3. WRAPPER SECTIONS:
   - §1 Purpose: Always include (why this exists)
   - §2 Scope: Include if boundaries need definition
   - §3 Audience: Include if not obvious from context

4. CONTENT SECTIONS (§4+):
   - Name them appropriately for your content
   - Add as many as needed
   - Each major topic gets its own numbered section

5. CLOSING SECTIONS:
   - References: Include if external resources cited
   - Document Info: Always include

6. KEEP IT LEAN: Wrapper is thin. Content is the point.
   Don't pad sections for completeness.
