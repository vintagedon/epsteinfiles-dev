## 2. Purpose

This directory captures research artifacts that inform processing decisions:

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| GDR outputs | Deep research on specific topics |
| Source analysis | Understanding document structure, quality, coverage |
| Related work | How other projects approached similar problems |

---

## 3. GDR Usage

[Gemini Deep Research](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/) outputs are stored here when used for:

- Scoping decisions
- Technical approach research
- Domain background

GDR prompts should follow the [NSB methodology](../../.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/) for bounded research.
